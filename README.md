# jepsen.mysql

Jepsen tests for MySQL and MariaDB on Debian Bookworm. You'll need [a Jepsen environment](https://github.com/jepsen-io/jepsen#setting-up-a-jepsen-environment) to run this test.

## Usage

Quickstart for a single-node test with closed-world predicates:

```
lein run test --db mysql --nodes n1 -w closed-predicate --concurrency 30n --rate 1000 --time-limit 120 -i serializable --nemesis none --key-count 40
```

Or for testing serializability in an RDS cluster:

```
lein run test --workload append --db none --nodes database-1.cluster-csraamczyi8q.us-east-1.rds.amazonaws.com,database-1.cluster-ro-csraamczyi8q.us-east-1.rds.amazonaws.com --nemesis none --max-writes-per-key 16 --rate 1000 --concurrency 10n
```

Or to reproduce violations of monotonic atomic view in MariaDB:

```
lein run test --nodes n1 --concurrency 10n --rate 10000 --time-limit 30 --db maria --isolation repeatable-read --workload mav
```
